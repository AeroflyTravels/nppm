      📌 💡 How to Choose the Right Travel Insurance
      
      When choosing a travel insurance plan, keep these factors in mind:
      
      - Destination: If you’re traveling abroad, make sure your policy covers international medical expenses.
      - Trip Duration: For long trips, consider coverage that extends to the full duration of your travel.
      - Coverage Limits: Ensure the coverage is sufficient to cover emergency medical care or trip interruptions.
      
      
      
      📌 📅 When to Buy Travel Insurance?
      
      - Before you book: Some plans offer cancellation coverage if you have to cancel the trip after booking but before departure.  
      - Before departure: Purchase it at least 2 weeks before departure to avoid any gaps in coverage.
      
      
      
      📌 💰 Cost of Travel Insurance
      
      The cost of travel insurance can vary based on:
      
      - Trip cost: More expensive trips typically cost more to insure.
      - Duration: Longer trips will increase your premium.
      - Age and health: Older travelers or those with pre-existing health conditions may pay higher premiums.
      
      On average, travel insurance costs between 4–10% of your total trip cost.
      
      
      
      📌 ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid
      
      - Not reading the fine print: Some policies may exclude certain events, like pandemics or pre-existing conditions.
      - Over-insuring or under-insuring: Don’t buy unnecessary coverage but make sure you’re adequately protected for your trip type.
      - Waiting too long: Don’t wait until the last minute — some benefits may be invalid if purchased too close to your departure.
      
      
      
      📌 🧳 Travel Insurance FAQs
      
      1. Can I use my domestic health insurance overseas?  
         - Domestic insurance may not cover international medical expenses, so always opt for international travel health insurance.
      
      2. Does travel insurance cover COVID-19?  
         - Many policies now offer COVID-19 coverage, but it’s essential to check the details as coverage varies by plan.
      
      3. Can I cancel my trip and get a refund?  
         - Trip cancellation coverage can reimburse you for non-refundable costs if you must cancel for a covered reason.
